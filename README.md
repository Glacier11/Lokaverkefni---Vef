# Lokaverkefni---Vef

Created by: Jökull Snær Gylfason 



This is project B from VEF2B3U in Tækniskólinn ísland 2017



This project takes in data about the concerts in iceland where you can query and filter it to find the one you want.
I uses a function that calls ajax to get the data to the website, the functions takes in parameters that are used to query or filter through the data.


Next Steps:
I could make the website look better then I could add a calander that is more user friendly. I realize now that having the hole query in one for loop would be much more efficient and faster in general.


In this project I used Jquery, Jquery-UI and bootstrap


I was able to get through all the major obsticles in my way for example it took me a while to figure out how to make the calander from and to to work.
